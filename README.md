# Road Accident Analysis in India (Excel & Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze historical road accident data in India to identify trends, understand contributing factors, and gain valuable insights for improving road safety. By leveraging the capabilities of Excel and Power BI, the project will provide a comprehensive analysis of road accidents across various aspects like time, location, vehicle types, and potential causes.

## Business Understanding
Road accidents are a significant concern in India, causing immense loss of life and economic burden. Understanding the underlying trends and causes of these accidents is crucial for developing effective road safety strategies. This project's findings can be valuable to various stakeholders, including:

1.Government Agencies: The insights can inform policy decisions on infrastructure development, enforcement measures, and public awareness campaigns.
Transportation Authorities: Identifying accident hotspots and vulnerable demographics can help prioritize safety improvements in high-risk areas.
2.Automobile Industry: Understanding accident types involving different vehicle types can guide the development of safer vehicles and technologies.
3.Public Awareness: Disseminating project findings can educate the public about safe driving practices and encourage responsible road usage.

## Data Visualization 

## Data Understanding
The project will utilize a dataset containing historical road accident data from India.  
* Traffic Volume: Lockdown's accident drop highlights strong correlation with traffic volume.
* Time of Day: Most accidents occur during daytime (56-58%), suggesting driver fatigue or higher traffic.
* Geographical Distribution: States like Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh report higher accident rates (traffic volume, infrastructure, driving habits?).
* Causes of Accidents:Overspeeding is the leading cause, demanding stricter enforcement and better driver education.
* Decrease in red light violations and drunk driving suggests potential impact of enforcement or awareness campaigns.
* Driver Demographics:Men and drivers aged 23-35 are involved in more accidents, hinting at risk-taking behavior and potentially, inexperience (younger drivers).
* Collision Types: Rear-end collisions are most frequent, possibly due to tailgating and distracted driving.
* Location Trends:Accidents are shifting from residential to open areas, possibly due to increased traffic volume or speeding.
* Most accidents occur on straight roads due to: False sense of security leading to reduced attentiveness,Speeding and potential loss of control.
* Difficulty judging distance and speed, increasing head-on or rear-end collision risks.
* Weather Conditions: Sunny/clear weather sees most accidents, suggesting overconfidence.
* Vehicle Factors: Normally loaded vehicles and two-wheelers have the highest accident rates. Newer vehicles are involved in more accidents, possibly reflecting a higher number on the road.
* Traffic Control: Accidents are less frequent at locations with blinking signals, but more common in uncontrolled zones. Uncontrolled intersections create confusion and increase accident risk.
* Pedestrian Safety: Uncontrolled intersections are a major safety hazard for pedestrians lacking designated crossing phases and clear signals.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial phase will involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and potentially transforming data points into usable formats for analysis.EDA and data preparation was performed using Excel.A limited amount of data was scraped from reports and PDFs, then transformed for analysis using Power BI.

## Conclusion
Analyzing India's road accident trends reveals crucial insights. Data-driven strategies and targeted interventions can create safer roads and promote responsible driving. This project showcases data analytics' power to tackle social issues and build a safer future.
