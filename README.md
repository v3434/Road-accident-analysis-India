Project Overview: Road Accident Analysis in India (Excel & Power BI)
This project aims to analyze historical road accident data in India to identify trends, understand contributing factors, and gain valuable insights for improving road safety. By leveraging the capabilities of Excel and Power BI, the project will provide a comprehensive analysis of road accidents across various aspects like time, location, vehicle types, and potential causes.

Business Understanding
Road accidents are a significant concern in India, causing immense loss of life and economic burden. Understanding the underlying trends and causes of these accidents is crucial for developing effective road safety strategies. This project's findings can be valuable to various stakeholders, including:

Government Agencies: The insights can inform policy decisions on infrastructure development, enforcement measures, and public awareness campaigns.
Transportation Authorities: Identifying accident hotspots and vulnerable demographics can help prioritize safety improvements in high-risk areas.
Automobile Industry: Understanding accident types involving different vehicle types can guide the development of safer vehicles and technologies.
Public Awareness: Disseminating project findings can educate the public about safe driving practices and encourage responsible road usage.
Data Understanding
The project will utilize a dataset containing historical road accident data from India.  
This data might include information on:
Accident details: Date, time, location (including state, highway, etc.)
Accident characteristics: Type of accident (collision, head-on, etc.), weather conditions, road type (straight, curved, etc.)
Vehicle details: Type of vehicles involved (car, truck, two-wheeler, etc.), number of vehicles involved
Casualty details: Number of fatalities, injuries
Data Cleaning and Preparation: 
The initial phase will involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and potentially transforming data points into usable formats for analysis.EDA and data preparation was performed using Excel.A limited amount of data was scraped from reports and PDFs, then transformed for analysis using Power BI.

Conclusion: 
By leveraging Excel for data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering, and using Power BI for data visualization, this project will create a comprehensive analysis of road accident trends and causes in India. This analysis will provide valuable insights that can be used by various stakeholders to develop targeted interventions and promote safer roads for everyone.

This project will:

Identify key trends in road accidents across different timeframes, locations, and vehicle types.
Analyze the leading causes of accidents, including factors like speeding, driver behavior, and infrastructure deficiencies.
Develop data-driven insights that can be used to inform road safety initiatives and policies.
Contribute to the broader goal of reducing road accidents and fatalities in India.
